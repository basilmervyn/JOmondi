                <p>
                    Forces of nature are powerful. They can upend the best laid plans and derail future planning. <br><br>

                    The Covid 19 calamity that has caused immense loss and suffering around the world is a graphic remainder of just how much naturally occurring threats can disrupt life as we know it.  <br><br>

                    Another increasing threat we face today is climate change. A growing body of scientific evidence shows that today’s disruptive climate changes have emanated from human activities conducted without regard to the environment or the planet. <br><br>

                    Evidence of climate change in Kenya includes extreme weather events such as rising temperature, irregular and unpredictable rainfall patterns resulting in drought and rising sea levels. <br><br>

                    The negative impacts of these changing climatic patterns include reduced agricultural productions leading to increased food insecurity, damage to infrastructure, increased health costs, and decline in the quality and quantity of water resources leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. <br><br>

                    Kenya’s economy is highly dependent on agriculture and it’s a natural resource base. This makes our country highly vulnerable to climate change and threatens our vision 2030 goal of creating a globally and prosperous nation with a high quality of life. <br><br>

                    Addressing climate change requires that we transform our economy by integrating climate change into development policies and actions across multiple sectors. <br><br>

                    This includes the climate change act, 2016 that provides a regulatory framework for an enhanced response to climate change and provides ways and measures to achieve climate resilient development.  <br><br>

                    The United Nations says the focus is to look beyond the pandemic to engineer recovery that will give young people hope that learning and job opportunities remain accessible to them. <br><br>

                    For the second year running, people celebrated World Youth Skills Day against the relentless Covid 19 pandemic. No one knows when this highly contagious disease will disappear, even as young people aged 15 to 24 years continue to bear its brunt. <br><br>

                    It is time to re imagine youth training post Covid 19. This is necessary to pull young people from the abyss of unemployment, under employment and debilitating poverty in most cases. <br><br>

                    The Chair for UNESCO for Higher Education Developmentfor a Green Economy (HEDGES) in Kenyatta University Dr Dorcas Otieno is involved in several projects that will make green economy a dream come true. <br><br>

                <p>
                    A green economy is defined as low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive economy. UN Environment promotes a development path that understands natural capital as a critical economic asset and a source of public benefits, especially for poor people whose livelihoods depend on natural resources. <br><br>

                    Kenya’s Ministry for education launched the competence based curriculum in 2017 as a solution to the disconnect between 8 4 4 system and labor market needs. <br><br>

                    TVET institutions have embraced this shift with zeal. <br><br>

                    With creation of TVET curriculum development assessment and certification council to develop CBC to TVET institutions, the country has revamped TVET training. The training model emphasizes close working ties with the industry and labour market actors to integrate teaching practice. <br><br>

                    This is necessary so as to impact the youth with green skills such that they are able to be green entrepreneurs and create opportunities for green jobs.On the 29th of August up to 12th of September, KU hosted delegates from South America, Asia and Africa at the graduate school in Kenyatta University for two weeks. The conference was organized by the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA)<br><br>

                    The main purpose was to create a curriculum that will incorporate green economy in schools and initiate climate justice in institutions this is crucial because people need this skills in order to create employment and sustainability. The realization of agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals also supports the growth of green economy.<br><br>

                    Currently HEDGES is working on a capacity building program within Kenyatta University to help sensitize the lecturers on the importance of a green economy and green skills. This is crucial because the lecturers are the main people who disseminate information to students this information will prove to be beneficial because it will help the individual be self-reliable and to actively be involved in climate justice.<br><br>

                    Climate justice is a term used to frame climate changes as an ethical and political issue, rather than one that is purely environmental or physical in nature. This is done by relating the causes and effects of climate change to concepts of justice, particularly justice and social justice. 
                    What is climate justice? Climate justice focuses on the root cause of climate making systematic changes that are required to address unequal burdens to our communities and realign our economy with our natural systems. <br><br>

                    As a movement, climate justice advocates are working from the grassroots to create solutions to our climate and energy problems that ensure the right of all people to live, learn, work, play and pray in safe, healthy and clean environments.

                    On the 8th of April 2021 Africa for SDGs in collaboration with Kenya Education Management Institute organized an arts workshop at the Kenya Educational Management Institute where youths from different universities including KU UNESCO from KU, University of Nairobi, Jomo Kenyatta University and Technical university of Mombasa attended. All this people came together to show case their talents and teach other.

                        In this segment Nice taught us how to weave mats using tapestries and a yarn ball. Skills like this are important when one wants to start his or¬ her own small business because it does not require a lot of capital. Innovation is highly encouraged because the mats need to have unique patterns that can attract customers.

                        Decorating using broken down egg shells was the most interesting form of art I have ever done all you needed to have was a carton box broken down egg shells, glue and paint. People made interesting decorations of which the pictures will be shown after this article.

                        As KU UNESCO members we learned a lot concerning the SDGs and how to relate them with our everyday hobbies and activities and as a club under KNATCOM we are also very determined to continue learning more about the sustainable development goals and how we can also educate others about the same. It is very crucial in this quest to save our planet, everyone who understands this should choose an SDG to work with and try to implement it in their community for the betterment of our planet.

                Residents of Katwekera in Kibra are really going through tough times as they are constantly being relocated by ongoing government projects most have been forced to demolish their houses and places of businesses due to warnings given to the people by the government. <br><br>

                Resent demolitions have happened due to the construction of a road that is cutting through Kibra to connect ngong road and langata road previous relocations happened due the Kenya Rilways Authority telling people to vacate their premises because the residents had encroached to close to the railway line that passes through Kibra while in real sense they are supposed to be thirty meters away from the railway line. <br><br>

                Most residents claim the notices are too short and that they need more time to find another place where they can move their families and goods.

                        Residents of Kibra are really crying out due to the constant demolitions there has been approximately three demolitions the first one was executed by the Nairobi sewage company when they wanted to construct sewage systems, the second one was done by the Kenya Rilway Authority when they wanted to fence the land around the railway line for safety purposes and lastly they have been inconvenienced by the ongoing road project. <br><br>

                        Some residents have been affected by all the constructions forcing them to move constantly and sometimes even losing house items. This has made them very uneasy because of the fear of their houses being demolished again. <br><br>

                        Others had rental houses and businesses. Most residents in Kibra own rooms which they rent out to other people and receive rent, others had businesses like showing football matches and places where young boys could go and play video games. All this sources of income have been cut short the residents who could live comfortably in Kibra have now suddenly woken up to not even having homes of their own. <br><br>

                        In conclusion the residents of Katwekera in Kibra have an appeal for the government to finally conclude construction of the road because the project had not been completed and it has been a couple of years since they began. Many residents of Kibra are aslo looking forward for the completion of the road because it will ease transport within Kibra and enhance security as well. <br><br>

                KU UNESCO members were able to attend the open air art exhibition at the Village Market Mall, Nairobi. It was pop up in support of art community in Kenya. <br><br>

                KU UNESCO Club was represented by several artists who showcased their art work for merchandising and marketing purposes. In attendance were, Lincoln Mwangi. Julius Omondi, Henry Omollo, Ruby Moraa and Joy Wanjiru. <br><br>

                The art exhibition experience created a safe and reliable networking platform as club members interacted with other artists from Nairobi and beyond. We emphasized on Sustainable Development (SDGs awareness. The following SDGs were emphasized by majority of artists especially from KU_ UNESCO Club. Some of the SDGs observed were SDG #1 No poverty, # 4 quality education and #5 gender equality. <br><br>

                The experiences begotten from the exhibition was that of entrepreneurship where most of the artist gained revenue by showcasing and selling their art work for a price this showed us that we could also do the same with our artist organizing art exhibitions and selling our art pieces to the public and the same time engaging people on matters art and how we can use our art to impact the society.
